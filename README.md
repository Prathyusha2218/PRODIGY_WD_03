#Tic-Tac-Toe Project 
-------------------------------
<p>This Project  is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. One player uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'. The objective is to be the first to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine squares are filled without either player achieving this, the game ends in a draw.
This project serves as a practical example of integrating HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality in web development.</p>
